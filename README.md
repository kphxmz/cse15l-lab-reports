Hi, my name is Kyle Pham. 
I am from Hayward, CA but really Vallejo. I consider myself a bay area kid.
I am 18 years old and majoring in Math CS at UCSD and an active member of an asian fraternity. 
I like watching anime, I recently caught up to One Piece and Boruto. Keep in mind One Piece has over 1000 episodes.
