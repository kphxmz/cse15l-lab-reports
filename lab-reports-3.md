# Lab Report 3: Researching Command 'Find'
* The four command-line options that I chosen, were
* `-i`
* `-l`
* `-c`
* `-L`

In finding these command-line options, I used this document: [grep Man Page](https://ss64.com/osx/grep.html)
## Command-line Option `-i`

In using the command `find -i`, this command ignores case disntiction. In the image below, you can see that in the quotation marks the word "CELL FACTOR" is in all captials. However, using the command-line option it tells `find` to ignore the upper cases and only access the string value itself. When running `find -i`, the terminal prints out lines with the given input, ignoring the capitalization of the word. This is beneficial when looking for certain words in a text file without needing to worry about the capitalization of a word.
